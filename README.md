</div>

3D Hapkit is a 3-DOF haptic device that was created as a customization project for [Hapkit 3.0](https://hapkit.stanford.edu/). The 3D Hapkit was presented as WIP Paper and Demo in [2023 IEEE World Haptics](https://2023.worldhaptics.org/wip-papers/). This device is an open-hardware haptic device designed to be low-cost(<$300) and easy to assemble, allowing users to input motions and feel programmed forces in three degrees of freedom. 

Moving forward, this 3D Hapkit will be deployed in the Johns Hopkins University Haptic Interface Design Course in Fall 2023!

The electronics of 3D Hapkit were consisted of three custom PCB([Link to Hapkit 3.0](https://hapkit.stanford.edu/build.html)), the size of an Arduino Uno and includes a microcontroller, motor driver/amplifier. The Hapkit board could be purchased from [Seeed studio](https://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/hapkit-p-1622.html). Also, you can manufacture your own PCB by combining the Arduino, motor driver and sensors. Here is a good starting point obtained from Seeed Studio([Files]()).

Those boards were communicated by using I2C protocol. We provided sample [Arduino code]() for follower and leader to get you started porgramming haptic virtual environments with you 3D Hapkit. The code includes the calculation of inverse kinematics and all readings values from sensors. 
### To use 
- Connect all I2C Ports(A4/A5).
- Connect all Ground Pin for three boards together.
- Choose one board as the leader and load the script(3DHapkit_Leader.ino).([Arduino IDE Download](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)).
    - If want to use Serial monitor in Arduino IDE, commented out the **Line 79**(3DHapkit_Leader.ino) in script.
    ```cpp
  #define PROCESSING 1 //connect to the processing for visualization
    ``` 
- Load the script(3DHapkit_Follower.ino) to two other boards. 
    - In **line 55** (**3DHapkit_Follower.ino**), assign the address #8 for follower #1
    ```cpp
  Wire.begin(8);                // join i2c bus with address #8
    ```
    - In **line 58** (**3DHapkit_Follower.ino**), assign the address #12 for follower #2
    ```cpp
  Wire.begin(12);                // join i2c bus with address #12
    ```


## Software 
We create a sample scene for demo purpose. Users are able to control a ball(shown in green) by the handle to pass through the holes. Our 3-DOF Hapkit is designed to simulate that virtual wall and present haptic interaction with the wall. The Processing ([Download Here](https://processing.org/download)) was used to provide a better visualization.
### To use 
 - Download the [Processing](https://processing.org/download).
 - Open the Processing and [deltaProcessing.pde]().
 - Connect the laptop to the leader board.
 - Check the USB port and change to correct one in **line 38**
     ```cpp
     myPort = new Serial(this, "com5", 115200); //change "com5" based on the local port connection 
      ```
 - Click 'Run'.
