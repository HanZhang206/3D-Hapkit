3D Hapkit is a 3-DOF haptic device that was created as a customization project for [Hapkit 3.0](https://hapkit.stanford.edu/). The 3D Hapkit was presented as WIP Paper and Demo in [2023 IEEE World Haptics Conference](https://2023.worldhaptics.org/wip-papers/). This device is an open-hardware haptic device designed to be low-cost(<$300) and easy to assemble, allowing users to input motions and feel programmed forces in three degrees of freedom. Moving forward, this 3D Hapkit will be deployed in the Johns Hopkins University Haptic Interface Design Course in Fall 2023.
